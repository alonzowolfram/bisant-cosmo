    # You can provide multiple variables, separated by commas (,).
    # Each variable provided will be used to subset each of the experiments defined by the four variables above,
    # so there will probably be unnecessary models built. That's OK; you can just ignore them.
    # If you have a subsetting variable but also want to conduct a differential expression experiment
    # WITHOUT subsetting, enter your subsetting variable(s), and add NA as another one. 
    subset_vars:

    # [Optional] Values of the above subset_vars to include when subsetting.
    # For each variable in subset_vars above, separate the values of that variable with commas,
    # and separate multiple variables with semi-colons (;). 
    # So, if subset_var_levels_manual is not empty, then for each value of subset_vars, 
    # the pipeline, _in addition to_ subsets by each level individually, will _also_
    # do a subset consisting of only the subset_var_levels_manual values. 
    # You can skip a subsetting variable by inputting NA.
    subset_var_levels_manual: 

    # [Optional] Percentile cutoff, expressed as a decimal, of the coefficient of variance (CV)
    # to filter genes before running differential expression via linear mixed models.
    # For example, if you enter 0.25, only genes with a CV >= the 25th percentile
    # of genes by CV will be kept.
    # This speeds up the time it takes to fit the linear mixed models.
    # If left blank, all available genes will be used. 
    cv_cutoff: 0.25

    # [Optional] Number of top differentially expressed genes to label on the volcano plots.
    # This number will be applied to either side of the plot, so if you enter 10,
    # [up to] 20 genes will be labeled on the plot. 
    n_top_genes: 15

    # [Optional] Cutoff for differentially expressed genes for heatmap, 
    # expressed as [maximum false discovery rate (FDR)],[minimum absolute log2 fold change (LFC)].
    # For example, if you want as your DE genes only those genes with an FDR < 0.05 
    # and an LFC > 1, you'd enter 0.05,1
    # If only one value is provided, it will be treated as the FDR.
    # If left blank, the FDR cutoff will be set to 0.25, 
    # and the minimum absolute LFC will be set to 0.58.

  #     Pathway analysis
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  pathway_analysis:

    # Pathway analysis is conducted using the FGSEA algorithm with pathways from mSigDB. 

    # [Optional] Absolute path to a CSV, TSV, or Excel (.xlsx) file containing the 
    # mSigDB pathway sets of interest. 
    # The format of the file should be as follows: 
    # The first column contains the main categories (e.g. "H" for hallmark gene sets,
    # "C2" for curated gene sets, "C5" for ontology gene sets).
    # The second column contains the subcategories (e.g. "CP:BIOCARTA" for the BioCarta subset
    # of the canonical pathways [CP] within the C2 sets, or "GO:CC" for the Cellular Component 
    # subset of the Gene Ontology [GO] gene sets within the C5 sets.)
    # If a main category does not include subcategories (e.g. the hallmark gene sets), fill in
    # "NA" (no quotation marks) as the value at the appropriate index in the second column.
    # DO NOT INCLUDE COLUMN HEADERS.
    # Here is an example using tab separators:
    #
    # H NA
    # C2  CP:BIOCARTA
    # C2  CP:REACTOME
    # C3  CP:PID
    # 
    # For more information on available pathways, see https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb. 
    # If left blank, the pipeline will automatically run FGSEA against ALL pathways in the 
    # following pathway sets:
    # H (hallmark pathways), C2:CP:BIOCARTA (BioCarta pathways), C2:CP:REACTOME (Reactome) pathways
    pathway_table_file: 

    # [Optional] Individual pathways to perform FGSEA against. 
    # If provided, FGSEA will be run against ONLY these pathways.
    # These pathways MUST be in the pathway sets listed in the table designated by pathway_table_file
    # (or the default pathways if pathway_table_file is left blank). 
    # Separate pathways with commas.
    # E.g.: BIOCARTA_GPCR_PATHWAY,REACTOME_REGULATION_OF_HMOX1_EXPRESSION_AND_ACTIVITY,HALLMARK_HEDGEHOG_SIGNALING
    individual_pathways:

    # [Optional] The maximum number of pathways to display on the FGSEA bar graphs.
    # The cutoff is determined by the pathway ranking score, which is given by 
    #   pathway ranking score = -log10(adjusted p-value) * abs(normalized enrichment score)
    # This value is optional, but highly recommended to use the default setting of 15.

    # We recommend "x_adj,y_adj", the adjusted coordinates created in the pre-DE module.
    dimension_name_vars_sa: x_adj,y_adj
    
    # [Optional] Name of variable in metadata giving grouping by which to perform nearest-neighbor profiling.

    # If not given, will default to `InSituType_clusters`.
    nn_cell_clust_var:
    
    # [Optional] How a cell's neighbors should be defined when performing nearest-neighbor profiling:
    # `radius`: all cells within the provided radius
    # `k`: The _k_ nearest cells, regardless of how far away they are
    # If not given, will default to `radius`.
    nn_type:
    
    # [Required] The cutoff value corresponding to `nn_neighbor_type`; 
    # if `nn_type` is `radius`, then `nn_cutoff` is the radius within which cells can be considered neighbors; the units of the radius will match those of the dimensions provided by `dimension_name_vars_sa`;
    # if `nn_type` is `k`, then `nn_cutoff` is the number of closest cells that will be considered a given cell's neighbor
